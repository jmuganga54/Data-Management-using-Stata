## Overview
There is a gap between raw data and statistical analysis. That gap, called data management.

## Keywords and Notes
### Listing observation in this book
I frequently use the `list` command to illustrate the effect of commands. Sometimes, I add options to the `list` command to maximize the clarity of the output.

For files with many observations, it can be useful to list a subset of observations. I frequently use the `in` specification to show selected observation from a dataset. 

For example
```
list idcode age hour wage in 1/5
```
Sometimes variables names are so long that they get abbreviated by the `list` command. This can make the listings more compact but also make the abbreviated heading harder to understand.

For example, the listing below shows the variables `idcode, married, marriedyrs and nevermarried` for the first five observation. Note how `marriedyrs` and `nevermarried` are abbreviated. 

```
list idcode married marriedyrs nevermarried in 1/5
```

The `abbreviated()` options can be used to indicated the minimum number of character the `list` command will use when abbreviating variables.

For example, specifying `abbreviate(20)` means that none of the variables will be abbreviated to a length any shorter than 20 characters. This function can be abbreviated as `abb()`. For example `abb(20)`

```
list idcode married marriedyrs nevermarried in 1/5, abb(20)
```
When the variable listing is too wide for the page, the listing will wrap on the page. As shown below, this listing is hard to follow, and so I avoid it in this book.

Sometimes, I add the `noobs` option to avoid such wrapping. The `noobs` option suppresses the display of the observation numbers, which occasionally saves just enough room to keep the listing from wrapping on the page.

```
list idcode ccity hours uniondues married marriedyrs nevermarried in 1/3, abb(20) noobs
```


```
* Which contains 10 observation about the TV-watching habits of four kids 
use tv1
```
```
list
```

Note how a separator line is displayed after every five observations. This helps make the output easier to read. Sometime, thought, I am pinched for space and suppress that separator to keep the listing on one page. The `separator(10)` option (which it can be abbreviate to `sep(0)`) omits the display of these separators.

```
list,sep(0)
```
In other cases, the separator can be especially helpful in clarifying the grouping of observations. In the dataset, there are multiple observation per kid, and we can add the `sepby(kidid)` option to request that a separator be included between each level of `kidid`. This helps us clearly see the grouping of observatios by `kid`

```
list,sepby(kidid)
```

### Chapter 2 | Reading and importing data files

>> Stata rhymes with data 
An old Stata FAQ

#### Introduction
Before you can analyze the data in Stata, you must first read the data into Stata.This section describes how you can read several common types of data files into Stata.

##### Changing directories
To read a data file, you first nee to know the directory or folder in which it is located and how to get there.

Say that you are using Windows and you have a folder names `mydata` that is located in your `Documents` folder. Using `cd` command shown below changes the current working directory to the `mydata` folder withing your `Documents` folder

```
cd /Documents/mydata
```

Say that you are using Unix (for example Linux or macOs) and your data files are stored in a directory named `~/statadata`. You could go to that directory by typing

```
cd /statadata
```

Consider the partially complete `cd` command shown below
```
cd "/
```
After typing the forward slash, we can pres the Tab key to activate tab completion, showing a list of possible folders that can be chosen via keystrokes or mouse clicks

#### What kind of file are you reading?
There are several data files that you can read and import into Stata. Additionally, Stata can import data saved in other file formats, including, Excell files(`.xls` and `.xlsx`), SAS files, IBM SPSS files, and dBase files (`.dbf`).

> `Reading versus importing`. In both instances, you are retrieving an external file and placing it into memory

#### 2.2 Reading Stata datasets
This section illustrate how to read Stata datasets.

```
/* Tis dataset contain information from a survey of five dentists, including
whether they recommed Quaddent gum to their patients who chew gum.
*/
use dentists
list
```

If you get the error message `"no; dataset in memory has changed since las saved` then you need to first use `clear` command to clear out any data you currently have in memory.

In addition to reading datasets from your computer, you can also read Stata datasets stored on remote web servers. For example below.

```
* reading stata data from remote location
use "https://www.stata-press.com/data/dmus2/dentists.dta"
list

```
Imagine you want to read only a subset of observation from `dentists.dta`

```
* reading ony the subset of observation 
use dentists if years >=10
list
```
We can even combine these to read just the variable `name` and `years` for those dentists who have worked at least 10 years, as shown below.

```
* combine use and reading two variables
use name years using dentists if years >= 10
list
```
The above command can help on memory usage.

The `sysuse` command allows you to find and use datasets that ship with Stata. The `sysuse dir` command lists all the examples datasets that ship with Stata.

Below the `sysuse` command read the examples dataset that you specify `auto.dta` is one of the commmonly used example datasets that ships with Stata. You can use this dataset by typing

```
* Reading dataset that comes with Stata
sysuse auto

* See all the datasets that comes with stata-press
sysuse dir
```
Theare are many other examples datasets used in Stata manuals but not shipped with Stata. You can list these example datasets by typing `help dta contents` or selecting `File` and then `Example datasets ...` from the main menu.

```
* Other datasets used in Stata manuals but not shipped with Stata
help dta contents
```

The `webuse` command reads the dataset you specify over the Internet.

```
* Reading the dataset specify over the Internet
webuse fullauto
```

#### 2.3 Importing Excel SpreadSheets
We can import Excel file using the `import excel` command as shown below. Note that I included the `firstrow` option, which indicates that the Excel spreadsheet contains the names of the variables in the firstrow

```
import excel dentists.xls, firstrow
```

Consider a different Excel file with more than one sheets, if the workbook contain more than one worksheet the first worksheet will be selected if you use the above command.

We can import the contents of other sheets by specifying the worksheet we want, using the option `sheet('dentists')`

You can also import data from excel file by specifying the range of cells you want by using the command `cellrange(A1:D6)

```
clear
* Importing data from excell file by specifying the cell range
import excel dentists3, firstrow cellrange(A1:D6)

```
